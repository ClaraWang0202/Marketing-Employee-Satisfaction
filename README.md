# Marketing-Employee-Satisfaction
##  The dataset was collected by Glaasdoor employee text reviews of their job from 2010 to 2017. Then, based on the type of job I separated between reviews of front-line employees and back office. Using text mining I computed several monthly aggregated variables such as job flexibility, compensation and career development. In addition I collected monthly customer satisfaction data for the same time period. A total of 100 firms approximately are matching for both data-sets. 
## Purpose: Identify what factors of employee experiences (flexibility,compensation, etc.) have a more positive effect on satisfaction.
